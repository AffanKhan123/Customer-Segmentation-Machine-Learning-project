# Customer-Segmentation-Machine-Learning-project
Customer Segmentation project using Clustering algorithms in Machine Leaning.
I performed the following tasks:
1.Perfromed data exploration
2. Performed data transformation
3. Performed elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
4. Performed data modelling using kmeans algorithm
5. Performed data modelling using multiple clustering algorithm
6. Performed comparison of the above ml algorithms and choose the best clustering algorithm for this project
